            Welcome to Dowell Survey, an app that allows a user to search, and
            based on that search they can create a survey. Creating a survey
            involves linking a form hosted on another server to our platform.
            The client gets to fill in some details about the survey and also
            his details like the email. After this QR code is created with the
            link to the survey attached. So, the data filled in the form goes
            directly to the client&apos;s database.

              possible under applicable law and the remaining provisions will
